Programming Assignment #1 by Justin Gray 

To run type "python dtree.py <data_set_name> <max_tree_depth>"

The data_set_name should be just the name of the dataset, without any folder
or other path info. The program assumes it will find a folder with the same 
name as specified in a folder name "prog1data". 

If you put 0 for max_tree_depth, it will be unlimited.
