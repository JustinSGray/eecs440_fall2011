All of the project relevant code is in ann.py

All of the data needs to be in a folder named "prog1data" in the current working directory where any data folders should be put. The program also relies on the shell folder being in the current working directory. 

This software was developed on python 2.6. 

simply run python2.6 ann.py <dataset_name> <hidden_nodes> <gamma> <max_iterations>
